This project is investigating some Data from Airbnb homes for Seattle, WA-USA. In this project, we will use the data to answer some crucial questions and get a better understanding of the elements of the data and make some useful insights. The purpose of this project is to learn, practice, and improve Data Processing skills.

## Project Motivation
The motivation behinds this project is picking a dataset from the few public datasets that are provided by Airbnb available on Kaggle, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, we will be working on 3 questions and try to find out satisfying answers.

## Data used
In this project we are using Kaggel to pull out all the needed data in order to do exploratory analysis and apply the CRISP_DM to get insights fron the Data
